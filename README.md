`adamantine` is a thermomechanical code for additive manufacturing. It is based
on [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org),
[ArborX](https://github.com/arborx/ArborX),
[Trilinos](https://www.trilinos.github.io), and [Kokkos](https://kokkos.org).
`adamantine` can simulate the thermomechanical evolution an object undergoes
during the manufacturing process. It can handle materials in three distinct
phases (solid, liquid, and powder) to accurately reflect the physical state
during manufacturing. Experimental data can be used to improve the simulation
through the use of [Ensemble Kalman
filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Kalman_filter).
